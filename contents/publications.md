# About Me

Hello, I am Xiujing, originally from Beijing, China, now a registered counsellor and parent coach in New Zealand.

I previously worked in project management and process management for a Fortune 500 high-tech multinational company in Beijing. This career background has equipped me with rigorous logical thinking and systematic problem-solving skills. However, after becoming a wife and mother, my deep exploration of parenting and interpersonal relationships led to a beautiful shift in my life’s trajectory. Over the years, I have systematically studied parenting courses both domestically and internationally.

After immigrating to New Zealand, I completed professional training in counselling and obtained certification from the New Zealand Association of Counsellors (NZAC). This training, combined with my life experiences in both Eastern and Western cultures, enables me to understand more comprehensively:

- The challenges faced by families from different cultural backgrounds  
- The psychological needs during the growth of children and adolescents  
- The mutual influence of marital relationships and family dynamics  

## Features of My Services

- **Engineering Thinking + Psychological Expertise**: Skilled in using clear frameworks to analyze complex psychological issues.  
- **Cross-Cultural Perspective**: Deep understanding of the dual cultural adaptation faced by immigrant families.  
- **All-Age Services**: From children’s counselling, adolescent emotional guidance, adult emotional management, to couples counselling.  

I believe that everyone has the power for self-growth within them, and good counselling acts like a mirror, helping us see ourselves more clearly and face life with greater ease.

- ✅ Someone who understands you and walks alongside you through difficult periods  
- ✅ Healthier emotional management skills
