## Working Together

I have experience in assisting individuals and family members navigate a wide range of difficulties, such as anxiety, depression, relationship challenges, feelings of loneliness, lack of control, low mood, powerlessness, and stress. Facing these issues alone can be extremely tough, and taking the first step to reach out to a counselor can often feel daunting, yet it is a courageous move.

As a counselor, I approach my work with warmth and empathy, and I am dedicated to offering support in a secure, private, and non-judgmental setting. My counselling sessions are designed to help you enrich your life and live it more fully, which might involve examining your habitual thoughts, emotions, and behaviours to understand what may be serving you well.

By working with me, you can find a place to process your emotions related to life changes or simply enjoy a dedicated “space” for yourself. Counseling can either concentrate on a particular issue or provide a free environment to explore all your thoughts and feelings at your own pace. Ultimately, how you choose to utilise this space is entirely up to you.

Together, we can adapt our approach to match your pace and expectations, with a strong focus on exploring the changes you desire.

## My Approach

Whether you prefer to talk online or in person, my appointments provide a safe space where you can discuss your situation compassionately and in complete confidence. Using Person-Centred Therapy, CBT, DBT, Sand Tray, Narrative Therapy, and Transactional Analysis, we can identify and work on the areas of your life that you’d like to address.

## For Parents:

A ten-session parenting course has been developed for delivery. The course content is scientific, comprehensive, and systematic. Through ten topics, it not only explains how to better raise children but also supports parents in taking better care of themselves. This course is suitable for parents of all age groups, and even parents with adult children have found it quite beneficial, significantly improving the parent-child relationship.

Being a parent is not an easy task. Regardless of your educational background, social status, or life experience, you are likely to encounter various “stuck points.” Being stuck is not your fault. Sometimes, you just need a little bit of support to overcome it.
